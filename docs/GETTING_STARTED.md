- OpenCV
- Visual Studio IDE

## Setting up the project

- Open the project solution via Visual Studio.
- Ensure that the code compiles by building the project solutions 
  - you might need to retarget the Windows 10 SDK version for each solution, if you don't have the exact SDK version installed as stated previously.

## Compiling and running the solutions

### Main Solution

#### Running the batch file

- ensure that you have an image named 'test.jpg' in the same directory as the batch file.
- Double-click the batch file. it should start the program.

#### Running the solution via Visual Studios

- Ensure that you have an image in the same directory as the solution 
- Run the solution in 'Debug' mode with the 'x64' configuration.
